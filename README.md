# bseries
Plots the open-water properties of Wageningen B-Series from data available in Bernitsas , "KT, KQ and efficiency curves for the Wageningen B-series propellers (1981)"

This is a non-GUI version of the software. 

## Use
The code can be launched via a command prompt, typing python bseries.py.
You will have to provide pitch ratios (P/D), number of blades (Z) and expanded area ratio (EAR = Ae/A0) for the calculations to be performed.

## Further use
This code is used in a code that provides the autopropulsion point, given ship resistance. See (insert ref)
